#Advice
1. Open the "readme.tex" file because it contains the same text, but with important parts highlighted.
2. Find the "come" file and see how to install the cross-platform module pyperclip, otherwise the code won't work! If pyperclip is already installed, skip this advice.

Open the file "Code.py" and open it in Visual Studio Code (abbreviated VSCode)
that is, click on any other file besides this one here in this repository on GitHub, then find
the "Raw" button, and a little further away from it is the printer icon with an arrow. Click on it, and then open the file!
